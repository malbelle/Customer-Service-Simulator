Welcome to your first day at the Coffee Fiend, valued employee! We're //so //happy to have you on our team!

Here at the Coffee Fiend, we're like one big happy family! And families have to pitch in and do their best to help each other flourish, now don't they? That's right! So get out there and make me proud!

Hm, training? Nah, you'll be fine. Just don't forget to //smile!//

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/cafe.jpg" alt="picture of cafe interior" /&gt;

''[[Get started!]]''
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Get started!" tags="" position="650,400" size="100,100">A bell tinkles above the door, signalling the entrance of your first customer. As you slide behind the counter, an elderly woman toddles over, wrinkled brow set in a sour frown.

"You there!" she barks, pointing a shrivelled finger. "Do you work here?"

You slowly look down at your apron and it's corresponding nametag. "Uh...yes?"

"You don't sound very sure," the woman sneers. "Can you help me or not?"

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/grumpyone.jpg" alt="drawing of old lady" /&gt;

a) [["Ma'am, I can help you."]]
b) [["I can help you find the door."]]
c) [["Don't talk to me like that, please."]]



</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="&quot;Ma&#39;am, I can help you.&quot;" tags="" position="650,525" size="100,100">The woman huffs, raking pale eyes over you in open derision. "Very well. I want a hot chocolate and a blueberry tart - heated up, mind. I can't //stand// cold pastry."

You bite your lip, dread gathering in the bit of your stomach. "Erm...I'm sorry, ma'am," you say, "but we don't actually offer blueberry tarts."

The woman puffs up in indignation. "You //what?"//

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/grumpytwo.jpg" alt="drawing of old lady" /&gt;

a) [["Are you deaf? We don't have blueberry tarts!"]]
b) [["I'm very sorry, ma'am. Can I offer you something else?"]]
c) [["Did you even look at our menu?"]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="&quot;I can help you find the door.&quot;" tags="" position="775,525" size="100,100">The women's face reddens in outrage, and spittle flies from her mouth. "H-How dare you!" she squawks, stamping a heeled boot. 

She squints at your nametag, mouthing it to herself. "Mark my words, you'll never work here again once I've spoken to your manager!"

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/grumpyfour.jpg" alt="drawing of old lady" /&gt;

a) [["I'm so sorry, ma'am! Let me make it up to you!"]]
b) [["I AM the manager."]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="&quot;I&#39;m very sorry, ma&#39;am. Can I offer you something else?&quot;" tags="" position="775,650" size="100,100">"Well, what //do //you have?" the lady fumes, scowling. She's staring at you suspiciously, like it's //your// fault you don't have the pastry she wants.

"We have...other tarts," you offer tentatively.

The lady sticks her nose in the air. "No," she sniffs, "I don't want other tarts."

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/grumpytwo.jpg" alt="drawing of old lady" /&gt;

a) [["Did you even look at our menu?"]]
b) [["Why don't we look through the menu together?"]]
c) [[Call over your manager]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="&quot;Did you even look at our menu?&quot;" tags="" position="525,650" size="100,100">The old lady draws herself up, eye twitching. 

"Excuse me?" she spits, spittle flying in every direction.

Uh oh, she looks mad! Quick, it's time to backpeddle!

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/grumpythree.jpg" alt="drawing of old lady" /&gt;

a) [["I'm very sorry, ma'am. Can I offer you something else?"]]
b) [["You're a rude cow, lady."]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, ma&#39;am! Let me make it up to you!&quot;" tags="" position="775,775" size="100,100">The old lady hesitates - then finally, she gives a tiny nod. "Fine. I'll ask this once, and once only: can. you. help. me."

She speaks slowly, like she's talking to a particuarly slow child.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/grumpyone.jpg" alt="drawing of old lady" /&gt;

a) [["Ma'am, I can help you."]]
b) [["You're a rude cow, lady."]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="&quot;You&#39;re a rude cow, lady.&quot;" tags="" position="775,900" size="100,100">Unsurprisingly, the customer doesn't take kindly to being spoken in such a way. She opens her mouth and begins to unleash upon you a string of expeltives so colourful you can't believe this elderly woman has even heard of them. By the time she's stomped out of the cafe in a huff, your ears are ringing and your spirit is significantly deflated.

Something tells you your first time is //probably// going to be your last, too.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/grumpyfour.jpg" alt="drawing of old lady" /&gt;

GAME OVER!

[[Ok]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Ok" tags="" position="775,1025" size="100,100">&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/googlereviewone.jpg" alt="drawing of old lady" /&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="&quot;Don&#39;t talk to me like that, please.&quot;" tags="" position="525,525" size="100,100">You try to keep a calm, polite facade. The lady splutters her way through some half-hearted speel about 'young people these days,' but she seems to settle down for the moment.

"I just want to know," she begins, speaking to you in a slow, condescending tone, "if you have any blueberry tarts."

Ah, yikes. Internally, you wince. This...probably isn't going to go well.

"Um...no, we don't," you say, trying not to cower. Who knew an old lady could be so intimidating!

The customer fixes you with a truly terrifying scowl. Quick, say something!

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/grumpytwo.jpg" alt="drawing of old lady" /&gt;

a) [["I'm very sorry, ma'am. Can I offer you something else?"]]
b) [["Did you even look at our menu?"]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="&quot;Are you deaf? We don&#39;t have blueberry tarts!&quot;" tags="" position="650,650" size="100,100">Yeah...there's no coming back from that. The old lady cusses you out for so long that you think you've gone deaf in one ear by the end of it.

Guess it's time to give Indeed another shot!

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/grumpyfour.jpg" alt="drawing of old lady" /&gt;

GAME OVER!

[[Ok]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="&quot;I AM the manager.&quot;" tags="" position="900,650" size="100,100">The priceless expression on the lady's face is so golden that you can't contain your laughter. It takes a few seconds for the customer to clock on - but when she does, she goes so red you're half afraid she's going to combust on the spot.

Instead, she whirls on her patented heel and storms from the cafe.

You're still laughing when your manager calls you into his office. Ah, well, it was worth it!

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/grumpyfour.jpg" alt="drawing of old lady" /&gt;

GAME OVER!

[[Ok]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Call over your manager" tags="" position="900,775" size="100,100">You're so flustered that the only soultion you can come up with is to flag your manager down for assistance.

He sweeps in and smoothes everything over, apologising to the lady and offering her a coffee - on the house! He even blames the entire situation on you!

When the old lady finally leaves - smirking at you at all the while - your manager turns to you and gives a disappointed sigh.

"This is the kind of thing you should really be handling by yourself, okay?"

You nod sheepishly, and the manager gives you a condescending smile. "Let's see if we can make it through the day without calling on me again, okay?"

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/grumpyone.jpg" alt="drawing of old lady" /&gt;

[[Next customer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="&quot;Why don&#39;t we look through the menu together?&quot;" tags="" position="650,775" size="100,100">It takes almost half an hour, but you go through the entire menu with the lady - twice! - before she finally selects a quiche. By the time th customer leaves, there's a line of impaitient customers waiting for you to take their orders!

As you hurriedly begin working through the line, your manager catches your eye on his way past and gives a disappointed shake of his head.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/grumpyone.jpg" alt="drawing of old lady" /&gt;

[[Next customer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Next customer" tags="" position="900,900" size="100,100">After dealing with a line of customers, the cafe remains peaceful for almost thirty full minutes.

Of course, knowing your clientele, this can't last very long.

A customer breezes in just as you return from a bathrooom break, sidling up to the register with a sheepish smile.

"Hi," you chirp, putting on your best customer-service smile. "What can I get for you?"

The customer glances at the chalkboard menu behind your head, squinting. "I'll have...a slice of banana bread, please."

You nod, tapping away at the register.

"Oh, wait!" says the customer, holding out a hand. "Sorry, I've changed my mind."

"No worries," you say, deleting the order.

"I want a jam tart," continues the customer, nodding to themselves.

You enter in the order. "Is that all for today - "

"Ooo, wait, no, not that," interjects the customer.

You resist a sigh.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/customer2sheepish.jpg" alt="drawing of sheepish person" /&gt;


a) [["Would you like a few minutes to decide?"]]
b) [["Please hurry up, there's people behind you."]]
c) [["Shall I recommend you something?"]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="&quot;Please hurry up, there&#39;s people behind you.&quot;" tags="" position="1025,1025" size="100,100">To your disbelief, the customer's eyes go big and wet.

"Oh, s-sorry," they mumble, averting their gaze. "Am I taking too long? I don't mean to be a...a burden."

You blink a few times, just to make sure you didn't hallucinate that interaction.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/customer2sad.jpg" alt="drawing of teary person" /&gt;

a) [["Are you for real right now?"]]
b) [["A burden is putting it lightly."]]
c [["No, of course not!"]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="&quot;Shall I recommend you something?&quot;" tags="" position="900,1150" size="100,100">The customer, to your relief, seems receptive to the idea. They smile, nodding encouragingly. Thank god!

"Do you have any idea what you might like?" you ask. "Or any dietary restrictions?"

The customer shakes their head.

"Okay," you begin, gesturing to the glass display case beside you, "as you can see, we keep our savoury goods on this side and our sweets on the other. Now, my personal favourite is our white chocolate rocky road -"

"I'm allergic to nuts," the customer interjects.

You grit your teeth. "Ok. Seems like you do, in fact, have some dietray restrictions."

The customer just blinks at you.

"How about a nice merignue," you persist, a touch desperately.

The customer makes a face. "No thanks."

Deep breath in, deep breath out. "What about a custard tart?"

"Nah."

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/customer2squinting.jpg" alt="drawing of person squinting" /&gt;

a) [["Please hurry up, there's people behind you."]]
b) [["Are you for real right now?"]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="&quot;Would you like a few minutes to decide?&quot;" tags="" position="900,1025" size="100,100">The customer waves you off, eyes returning to the chalkboard menu. Their brows scrunch into apparent concentration, tongue poking out between their teeth. You don't think you've been so focused on anything in your entire life.

"Hmmm," says the customer, tapping a loose rythym against the countertop. "Maybe...maybe a quiche?"

"What kind of quiche?" you prompt, the very embodiment of politeness. Honestly, you should've gone into acting school. "We've got vegetarian, bacon and leek, and cheese and mushroom."

The customer hums under their breath for what feels like an eternity.

"...lemon," they say finally.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/customer2squinting.jpg" alt="drawing of person squinting" /&gt;


a) [["...what."]]
b) [["Shall I recommend you something?"]]
c) [["Please hurry up, there's people behind you."]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="&quot;...what.&quot;" tags="" position="1025,1150" size="100,100">You can't help it; you stare in complete bewilderment. The customer, of course, seems completely oblivious.

"Listen," you attempt, "I can't help you if I don't know what you want. So if you're not sure, why don't you step aside and let someone else order."

"But I know what I want," the customer protests. It comes out as almost a whine.

"Then what is it?" You're practically begging now, hands cupped in front of you as though beseeching some ancient deity.

The customer opens their mouth confidently - then pauses. "Ummmm..."

Your poker mustn't be as good as you'd thought, because the customer's expression sudddenly morphs into something deeply insecure. "I'm really being a massive burden right now, aren't I?"

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/customer2sad.jpg" alt="drawing of teary person" /&gt;


a) [["Get out of line. Now."]]
b) [["No, of course not!"]]
c) [["A burden is putting it lightly."]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="&quot;Are you for real right now?&quot;" tags="" position="1150,1150" size="100,100">There's real anger in your voice, and if the way the customer starts blubbering like a baby is any indication, they seem to pick up on it.

"T-There's no need to be r-rude," they protest, voice half-hurt and half-accusing. "I just wanna make sure whatever I get is going to one-hundred percent satisfy me. Is that so bad?"

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/customer2sad.jpg" alt="drawing of teary person" /&gt;


a) [["No, of course not!"]]
b) [["Get out of line. Now."]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="&quot;A burden is putting it lightly.&quot;" tags="" position="1025,1275" size="100,100">The customer's entire face flushes, tears spilling down their face. 

Around you, people begin to gossip, gazing at you out of their peripherals with accusatory frowns. Honestly, anyone would you'd just kicked a baby in front of them!

Of course, it doesn't take long for the commotion to draw the attention of your manager, who materialises from their office like a ghostly apparition. 

"Hi there," your manager greets, grinning with every single tooth, "I'm the manager of this establishment. What seems to be the problem?"

It takes mere seconds for the customer to paint you as a fiendish villain.

It takes even less for your manager to grant them a free dessert and a heartfelt apology.

"You know you're fired, right?" they ask you as you both watch the customer leave.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/customer2verysad.jpg" alt="drawing of crying person" /&gt;


[["Yeah."]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="&quot;No, of course not!&quot;" tags="" position="1150,1275" size="100,100">You wave your hands frantically, hoping to salvage the situation.

"You're fine," you reassure, ignoring the impaitient groan from a customer behind you. "I just want to help you find something you're gonna love."

The customer beams, face clearing like clouds parting to reveal the sun. You spend the next forty minutes in sheer agony as the customer waffles back and forth between their choices, umming and ahhing over every item on the menu.

Finally, after all that hard work, the customer looks at you thoughtfully and declares, "Actually...I don't think I want anything from here after all."

And with that, they turn and sashay out the door.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/customer2sheepish.jpg" alt="drawing of sheepish person" /&gt;


[[Fuck my life.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="&quot;Get out of line. Now.&quot;" tags="" position="1275,1275" size="100,100">You don't even care anymore; your outburst is worth it just to see the look on the customer's face.

Their mouth drops open, jaw quivering in unfathomable despair.

"You're the r-rudest person I've ever met in my life!" they snap at you, though the effect is kind of ruined by the snot and tears mixing on their chin. Ugh.

You watch in content silence as the customer flees the store, ignoring your manager when they appear your over shoulder.

"You know you're fired, right?"

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/customer2verysad.jpg" alt="drawing of crying person" /&gt;


[["Yeah."]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="&quot;Yeah.&quot;" tags="" position="1025,1400" size="100,100">&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/customer2review.jpg" alt="hand-drawn google review" /&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Fuck my life." tags="" position="1150,1400" size="100,100">Blessedly, you’re granted a lunch break at half-past twelve. You sequester yourself away in a corner of the café and chew through a stale sandwich, streaming a Netflix show on your phone.

At one o’clock, you slide back behind the register and find a middle-aged customer perusing the glass case, a small child balanced on their hip.

“Hello, dear,” they chirp, setting the child down.

“Hello,” you reply, slinging your apron back over your head. “I hope you weren’t waiting very long.”

“Oh, no, not at all,” says the customer. “In fact, I was just tossing up between a Boston cream and a chocolate éclair.”

You give a sympathetic smile. “Mm, it’s a hard choice. Let me know when you’ve decided.”

“I haven’t had an eclair,” continues the customer, “since 1995. It was at this French food festival in my hometown, and my boyfriend at the time, William, was telling me all about this fancy new car he got. Now, I’ve never much cared for cars, but to listen to him prattle on you’d think he’d gone out and bought the latest Ferrari model. Well –”

You glance nervously behind the customer as they chatter on, eyeing the line steadily gathering behind the till.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/talking4.jpg" alt="drawing of smiling person" /&gt;

a) [["So you'll be wanting an eclair, then?"]]
b) [["Wow, that's so interesting."]]
c) [["Please stop talking and just order something."]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="&quot;So you&#39;ll be wanting an eclair, then?&quot;" tags="" position="1150,1525" size="100,100">The customer chuckles, shaking their head. “No, I didn’t say that. I think it’s probably for the best if I don’t indulge in too much chocolate, at the moment; my husband Gerard was just telling me the other day I ought to eat healthier, but I’d like to see him try and find time to whip up an elaborate salad every day while also taking the kids to school and walking the dogs –”

People in line begin to grumble, muttering discontentedly to each other.

“I think,” you say, your smile already growing thin, “that perhaps, if you aren’t sure what you’d like, then – ”

“No, No, I’m sure what I want,” interjects the customer. “I’ve always been sure what I want, actually; mother always said that I was such a stubborn child…”

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/talking4.jpg" alt="drawing of smiling person" /&gt;

a) [["Mm hm."]]
b) [["Omg I don't care."]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="&quot;Wow, that&#39;s so interesting.&quot;" tags="" position="1275,1525" size="100,100">The customer nods pleasantly. The child tugs impatiently at their leg, but they ignore them and continue right on talking.

"The thing is, I'm more of a boat person, but my husband sold our boat years ago when the stock market crash. He's in finance, you see, and he's always trying to save a little extra cash here and there, but I was very fond of that boat! And it's not fair, you know, to just sell a shared asset without discussing it with your spouse. In fact, the boat was a gift from his grandfather to us on our wedding day, but doees my husband care? Nooo, he just goes off and sells it one day while I'm out getting my hair done."

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/talking4.jpg" alt="drawing of smiling person" /&gt;

a) [["Woow."]]
b) [["Omg I don't care."]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="&quot;Please stop talking and just order something.&quot;" tags="" position="1025,1525" size="100,100">The customer raises both brows, looking affronted. “Now, now, that’s not very nice. You know, they say manners never go out of style, but I really think this generation is just //so// disrespectful. Why, just the other day, I was at the bus stop when a young man approached me and asked -"

Someone calls out from the line, "No one cares! Just order something!"

You bite your lip to keep from laughing, but the customer carries on like they hadn't heard a thing.

"So anyway, I said to this man, 'Where do your parents think you are?' and do you know what he told me?"

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/talking2.jpg" alt="drawing of frustrated person" /&gt;

a) [["No, what did he say?"]]
b) [[cry]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="&quot;Mm hm.&quot;" tags="" position="1150,1650" size="100,100">"My way or the highway it was, according to her. One time, in fact, I wasn't allowed an ice cream cone because I'd been naughty that day. I'd had a ballet recital, you see, and I screamed and screamed because I didn't want to perform! And my mother had me in this terrible pink tu-tu that clashed horribly with my hair, and I was determined not to go on stage, and I cried so much my mother threatened to leave me on the side of the road. Ahaha! But even after I finished the concert, she wouldn't buy me this big chocolate waffle cone I wanted because I'd made such a fuss beforehand."

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/talking1.jpg" alt="drawing of person talking" /&gt;

a) [[scream]]
b) [["Yeah, I know what you mean."]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="&quot;Omg I don&#39;t care.&quot;" tags="" position="1275,1650" size="100,100">This is it: you've had enough. You've hit rock bottom. You've stuck it out for this long, but no money in the world is worth this torment. So as your customer splutters in protest, you just chuck off your apron and walk out of the cafe without a backwards glance.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/talking3.jpg" alt="drawing of frustrated person" /&gt;

[[Move back in with your parents]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="&quot;Woow.&quot;" tags="" position="1400,1650" size="100,100">"Oh, my hair! That's another thing my husband can't stand! Recons it's too expensive to let his poor wife go to the salon every now and again, as if he doesn't go to the races every weekend and blow hundreds of dollars on the horses! But then he's so tight with money in other areas! Like, for example, I was saying just the other day that we really ought to take our children overseas so they can experience some real// culture,// and you know what he says to me? He says he doesn't see the point! Says kids are too spoiled these days, and he won't have our children turning out like that."

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/talking1.jpg" alt="drawing of person talking" /&gt;

a) [["Huh. Wild."]]
b) [["Omg I don't care."]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="cry" tags="" position="1025,1650" size="100,100">Yeeaah, that's it. You slump over the till and just weep, your shoulder shuddering with a barrage of sobs while customers awkwardly shuffle from the cafe. 

The customer at the till keeps talking for several minutes before growing frustrated with your lack of attention and moving on.

Your manager finds you about ten minutes later, but they're so uncomfortable at the sight of your tears that they just kind of...leave you to it.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/talking3.jpg" alt="drawing of person sighing" /&gt;

Why, I'd never been thus spoken to in my life! I was scandalised! And to hear such filth out of this young man's mouth...but that's the thing, isn't it? No one wants to disicipline their children! They'd rather the robots in their ipads do it, and then they're left scratching their heads and wondering why their little brats won't cooperate at home and give their teachers trouble at school!"

They haven't the stomach for it. They don't understand that children are a lifetime commitment, you know? You can't just ignore them! They need your attention, or else they'll grow to become resentful and cruel. I bet your parents were brilliant; you're so polite. And you get to work in this lovely cafe all day and talk to customers! Honestly, if I didn't love my job so much, I'd come and work with you, haha."

Not even your talkative customer, who seems annoyed to be drowned out.

And honestly? Good for you.

But you know, I don't much fancy chocolate ice cream now. In fact, I'm much fonder of vanilla. Isn't it strange how these things change from when you're a kid? I remember I hated peas as a child, just hated them! But now? Well, now I simply can't get enough! I had pea soup last night for dinner, that's how mad for peas I am. And yet, my own children can't stand peas; I had to make a separate dinner just so they'd eat something - and of course, that meant another trip to the grocery store so I could buy some fish fingers."

But when I try to tell Gerard this, he dismisses me outright - claims I don't know what I'm talking about, like I haven't been a school teacher for the past ten years!

"You're such a sweetheart, listening to me ramble on. I do hope I haven't been holding you up."

And before you can open your mouth and inform them that, actually, you'd like nothing more than to never hear another word from their garrulous mouth, they start right back up again.

Forty-five minutes. That's how long it takes to hustle them out the door.

At least they leave you a ten-cent tip.

[[Last Customer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Last Customer" tags="" position="900,2025" size="100,100">Final hour of the day. You’re all but leaning against the till, feet aching and brain hurting, watching the minutes tick by and praying no one else steps through the door.

Luck, of course, is not on your side.

“Hello there, dear,” calls an elderly gentleman, hobbling into the café. “Been busy today?”

“You could say that,” you offer blandly.

The man chuckles and reaches the counter. “Sorry to hear that, sweetheart. Don’t worry, I’ll make this nice and quick for you.”

He winks, and your brows raise into your hairline.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/oldman5.jpg" alt="drawing of old man smirking" /&gt;

a) [[Sweetheart??]]
b) [["No problem, what can I get you?"]]
c) [["Actually, my name tag is right here."]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="Sweetheart??" tags="" position="900,2150" size="100,100">The man ignores you, seeming not to hear. He begins to read the chalkboard menu on the wall behind you, scratching at his white beard. “Right then. I’ll have a cappuccino and a gingerbread man.”

Still annoyed, you silently enter the order. “Your total is seven twenty-five.”

The man nods and begins to dig through a small coin purse. “Here you go, darling,” he says, pressing a handful of coins into your palm.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/oldman2.jpg" alt="drawing of old man smirking with eyes closed" /&gt;

You resist a shudder. 

“Right," he continues, "can I give you my order here, or do you need a notepad? I wouldn’t want you to get confused.”

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/oldman2.jpg" alt="drawing of old man smirking with eyes closed" /&gt;

After a moment, he withdraws with a laugh. “Sorry, honey, I haven’t brought my glasses with me. Now, love, I’ll have a cappuccino and a gingerbread man if it’s not too much trouble.”

He dumps a pile of tiny silver coins on the counter as payment.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/oldman2.jpg" alt="drawing of old man smirking with eyes closed" /&gt;

Unfortunately, under his unsettling gaze, you find yourself getting distracted and having to re-count. 

By the time you're finished, you're not entirely certain you've got the correct change.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/coins.jpg" alt="drawing of coins" /&gt;


a) [["Your change is sixty-eight cents."]]
b) [["Your change is two dollars eighty."]]

"Why not?" you drawl, raising a brow. "You've been speaking to me like this the whole time."

The man splutters for a few minutes longer, growing increasingly red in the face. 

You know you have a chance to salvage this, probably - but do you want to?

He scoops the change back into his palm and winks. "I'll just wait over here for my coffee. Have a nice day, darling."

You grit your teeth so hard you swear you can hear them crack.

a) [["Have a nice day!"]]
b) [[Ignore him]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="&quot;Your change is two dollars eighty.&quot;" tags="" position="1025,2400" size="100,100">The man fixes you with a pitying look, tutting under his breath.

"What do they teach in schools these days?" he wonders aloud. He begins explaining your mistake to you, reclaiming the correct change. When you try to apologise, he waves you off with a gentle smile.

"It's not your fault, love. Clearly maths isn't your strongsuit."

He leaves with his cappuccino shortly afterward, and you think that's the end of it - but later that night, you see he's left a scathing google review about your inability to count!

Needless to say, your manager isn't best pleased that you've attracted such negative attention on your first day.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/oldman2.jpg" alt="drawing of old man smirking with eyes closed" /&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="&quot;Have a nice day!&quot;" tags="" position="900,2525" size="100,100">Shortly after the man has left with his order, your manager approaches you with his phone angrily brandished. 

"What is this?" he demands, showing you the screen.

You stare, perplexed. It's a negative review from the old man - about you!

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/oldmanreview.jpg" alt="angry google review" /&gt;

"That can't be right!" you object hotly. "I was nice to him!"

"Sure you were," snorts your manager. "Still, it's only your first day...I suppose. But don't let it happen again."

He walks away, and though you've survived the shift, you can't help but feel like you've lost all the same.

By the time your manager has dispatched the angry man, you've already tossed your apron aside and exited the cafe. 

No point sticking around for the inevitable firing.

He places his order, then dumps a pile of tiny silver coins out into the counter as payment.

"What are you after today?" you ask finally, once you trust yourself to speak.

The man clicks his tongue in thought. "I think I'll just have a cappuccino, thanks, hon. Oh, and a gingerbread man."

You nod, a slew of colourful curses whirling through your mind.

"What do I owe you, sweetheart?" inquires the man.

Your head snaps up, your heartbeat pounding in your ears; you can't help yourself. "An apology for the way you've been treating me, you bastard."
